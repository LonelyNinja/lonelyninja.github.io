# Universal Policies
## Civility Policy
Civility is essential for a group of 100+ people from all over the world to get along.

All admins must treat each other with respect and courtesy in all communications and disputes. We are all on the same team and must act like it.

Admins have a duty to recognize breaches of the civility norms and help enforce the rules of civility. Do not allow a friend to succumb to the Big Mad.

Volunteers need to keep each other accountable and discuss things directly with each other, but they must assume and engage in good faith.

## Admin Camera 
Admin camera (cam) is a useful tool, but it also has potential for abuse and the appearance of abuse. 

No more than two admins (one on each team) should be in cam at a time.

Do not ever share information from cam with players. Resolve the situation and then exit. 

Active players should minimize their usage of cam. Consult with other admins to see if they can help manage issues such as ticket count, team kills, and kit enforcement.

Administrators bear the responsibility to neither act on nor appear to act on information obtained through cam. Abuse of cam for a gameplay advantage is considered the most serious violation of trust and buys a one-way ticket to the Moon.

## VOIP Request 
In-game chat is not suited to prolonged or complicated discussions.

Disagreements in-game that are not resolved after a few minutes should end. Game-breaking situations must be resolved, but further discussion should take place in a VOIP channel. 

Any admin may request any other admin to meet in VOIP. This request will obligate both admins to meet for a VOIP discussion. If no resolution can be reached through VOIP, shelve the topic and message a HQ, Relations, or Command member.

To ignore a VOIP request in order to play the game is a violation of policy. Unreasonable use or abuse of the VOIP request policy will be harshly scrutinized.

## Admin Chat

Admin chat is where admins share information in real time. Admins should do their utmost to read and participate in admin chat.

Say hello when you join a game.  Before any big decisions, gather information about map choices, previous votes, and the status of team balance.

We are not all in your VOIP! Decisions made for the server should be confirmed in admin chat after sufficient discussion. 

Use admin chat to share information, investigate problems, and resolve issues. Do not hesitate to ask other admins on the server about problems you run into. 

## Discord Chat

Discord is the platform we use to share information, post announcements, and host topic discussions that require thinking. 

Problems, decision analysis, or challenges come through admin channels on Discord. Admins should read and participate in #admin-barracks and #problem-players discussions.

Approach any disagreement constructively and with maturity. Be open about your opinion, honest with other admins, maintain civility, and stay willing to learn.

Solve problems at the lowest level. Reach out to proactively clear up misunderstandings from the server or in Discord.
