title: TT Admin Lite Guidelines
--- 

Situation:
 As the server grows in popularity and time populated, the HQ team has been unable to keep up with the timezone demands and this has resulted in the server being adminless at times or non NA primetime admins being overworked. These times of server pop have had much lower levels of gameplay, higher instances of player base issues and problem players not being removed.
Intent:
 Solve this by creating much wider and more consistent admin coverage, thereby increasing server quality and decreasing admin work load.
Implementation:
In addition to recruiting full HQ members from those timezones, we are recruiting junior members of the TT community or those that don’t want the hassle of being a full HQ member, but want to deal with major server issues when no HQ members are active

Policy:

Keep admin actions to a minimum when HQ members are online unless asked to or a situation isn’t being resolved.
You and your actions will be held to a high standard as you represent us all, please keep everything mature and professional.
 Will not have the same responsibility level or activity requirements as HQ. Help out when you are on and see something, but don’t stress about it. Avoid drama and ask for assistance as needed
 You do not have access to long bans, if there are repeat offenders that keep rejoining the server or players causing severe issues that you feel deserve a ban tag @HQ and we will help ASAP. Make sure to write in problem players any bans that you believe should be implemented or major problem players you ran into. 
Write in the admin lite room any questions you have on actions or possible situations. We gave you the power because we trust you to do what you think is best, all of us are always open for clarification and working to be better.
Kick/ban format: Clearly stated rule being broken and what to change, and discuss @discord.io/trig
If you have any questions or concerns regarding player interaction please contact @relations, Kievn or Randy. They will smooth out any drama.

Powers:
Will not have access to HQ discord, will have separate discord channel and role, access to SquadJS chat log and misc keyword log, admin ping, problem players and admin lite room.
ingame abilities: warn, kick, admin chat, admin broadcast, change map, set next map, force team change
BM: view bans, Broadcast, shownext, change map, setnext, force team change, list squads, warn player, remove from squad, disband squad, demote commander, kick players
SquadJS though admin chat: !kill, !seed, !live, !whitelist, !allchat, !discord, !help, !kick, !warn
Enforcing the rules:
Have a clear understanding of the rules and TT primer/ideals, but also know where the limit of the admin lite mandate is. 
Admin lites should be enforcing clear black and white rules that are gamebreaking and other severe acts such as teamkilling, offensive language directed at players, severe chat and mic spam, obvious trolling/harming of team, oneman locked squads that aren’t heli/logi/recon veh
Dealing with no mic SLs/non SL kit squads. Use your best judgment here, if there aren’t players willing to step up and take over a squad, then constantly kicking or disbanding solves nothing. Do what you think will help the team without fucking over unknowing/new  players. Use warns liberally to save the kicks and disbands for unresponsive. In the end if the squad is working with the team and slightly organized, leave it alone.
Have patience during seeding and do your best to curb players rather than kicking them and dropping server pop, use the !kill command in adminchat to disrupt their actions and tell them why it was done.

Final comments:
Most of all, have fun on the server and help create the environment that first brought you to the server. Your number one job is having fun, and after that help with enforcement where and when you can. We appreciate anyone willing to step out of their comfort zone for the greater good of the community, and will back you and any reasonable actions.

Again thank you for accepting this position and if you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to ask any member of HQ, anything. More specific points of contact are.

Napalm, Kievn, Randy, Flax
