# Courthouse Guidelines and Etiquette

* All discussion of a ban between admins and Player Relations should be done in `#Problem-Players` or via private message.
* Decisions relating to a ban will be communicated in `#Problem-Players/#Daft-Cunts`
* All communications between banned players and admins should be routed through `#Jail-and-Courthouse` or a player relations representative.
* Admins may only post in `#ban-appeals` when they are directly involved in a ban and only if their intention is to completely lift/resolve it. Anything less than a full removal of a ban should be communicated only by player relations.
* Admins posting in `#jail-and-courthouse` should limit their communications to minor variations of the following: 
    * I accept your apology/reasoning. Your ban has been rescinded.
    * Currently, your ban is set to expire on dd/mm/yyyy. A member of the @Relations team will answer any further queries about your ban.
* All communications in `#jail-and-courthouse` should be direct and professional.
* Player Relations may only overturn a ban if one or more of the following is true:
    * The admin directly involved with the ban agrees.
    * If there is insufficient information relating to the ban present. (The responsible admin has 24hrs from the initial appeal to support their ban in `#Problem-Players` after which it will fall under the discretion of Player Relations.)
    * It is determined that the ban is unwarranted as dictated by server rules.
* VAC Ban whitelist appeals will fall under the same guidelines as a standard appeal.
