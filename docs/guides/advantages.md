Hi all,

I wanted to share something that you may find informative for understanding RAAS information-imbalances in different layers. You may consider this when setting maps/layers. All RAAS lanes were assessed for the likelihood a team is able to confirm the RAAS-lane on a per-lane basis given reveal of one, two, three, and four points (the midpoint). We categorize the advantage into four buckets (ordered here in terms of most to least information advantage):

(1) One team has 100% certainty to confirm the lane, other team has 0% chance to confirm the lane - in this case one team knows for certain that they have an advantage
(2) One team has 100% certainty to confirm the lane, other team has >0% chance to confirm the lane
(3) One team is more likely to confirm the lane than the other team, but neither team has 100% certainty to confirm the lane
(4) Both teams have equal likelihood to confirm the lane

Then we summarize the information advantage in two ways. First, is the map generally favoring team 1, team 2, or neither in terms of information advantage. Secondly, can given any RAAS-lane, should you expect that a team to have an advantage over the other.

The summary view provides a visual depiction of these differences on the X- and Y- axes. This plot only shows RAAS layers where information differences were found. If no information differences were found, then those layers were not included in this chart.
