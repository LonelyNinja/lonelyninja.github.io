# Guidelines for Map Votes

Admins are encouraged to set maps and start map votes. Map decisions are agreed upon through admin chat. See the Admin Reference Sheet for instructions on how to initiate a map vote.  These guidelines are non-exhaustive:

Avoid repeating recently played maps. Use the `!maps` command or check the `#maps-played` channel for a list of recent maps.

Discuss options with all other admins and allow time for replies. Do not surprise admins with a “sneak set” or surprise vote. Utilize an `!admin` ping to alert other admins when a map discussion takes place.

Admins are responsible for compromise. Use reason, strike deals, negotiate, and compromise. “We can set your pick now, but then we can run this vote next” or “we haven’t played a helicopter layer recently. Can we do a full monty vote?”

We need a variety of maps and layers to keep the gameplay fresh on the server. Account for the previous maps, game mode, size, terrain, and assets.  A wide array of player preferences require admins to consider maps with the entire server in mind. 

Avoid last minute map scrambles. We can comfortably figure out map and vote choices in the first fifteen minutes of a game.

Game mode votes, map size votes, or specific layer votes are acceptable methods to select the next map. Sequential votes (e.g. first vote map size, second vote map) are encouraged when time permits.

You can find the layer information spreadsheet pinned in the #admin-bulletin Discord channel. Further information can be found at https://squadmaps.com/ and https://squadlanes.com/

## Recommended Late Night Maps / Layers

After 12AM EST, stick to “safe” maps to help maintain server population. We strongly recommend you stick to R/AAS layers past 12am. The time for experimentation is during prime-time hours (roughly 4PM-11PM EST). Here is a list of maps we consider safe:

* Yehorivka (RAAS v1, v3; AAS v1)
* Narva (any AAS or  RAAS v1)
* Gorodok (RAAS v1, v2, v5, v4 small)
* Sumari (AAS v1; RAAS v1)s
* Goose Bay (AAS v1; v2 RAAS v1)
* Kokan (AAS v1, RAAS v1, v2)
* Chora (AAS v1; RAAS v1, v2)
* Mutaha (AAS v1, v2, RAAS v1)
* Fallujah (AAS v1, v2; RAAS v1, v2, v3)
* Black Coast (AAS v1; RAAS v1, v3, v4)
* Harju (AAS v1, AAS v2 inf; RAAS v1, v2, v6)
