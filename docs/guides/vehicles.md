One-man locked squads are not permitted. There are exceptions for:

* Helicopters/Logistics

“Soft-locking” squads by auto kicking every player who joins will be considered squad locking...

Vehicle assets are first come, first serve for who gets in them first.

One-manning: Any vehicle worth 5 tickets or fewer can be one-manned. All vehicles that both: (1) are worth 10 or more tickets, and (2) require crewman kits, cannot be one-manned. Do not ever leave main without two crewmen in the vehicle if two crewmen are required (no picking up in the field).

# Vehicle Categories

|Category |   Description|
|---------|--------------|
|Main Battle Tanks|MBTs are the most powerful land vehicles in Squad. With unmatched long range firepower and heavy armor, they're the kings of the battlefield|
|Mobile Gun Systems|MGSs are fire support vehicles equipped with tank cannons but light armor|
|Infantry Fighting Vehicles|IFVs are autocannon-equipped vehicles that can also transport infantry in a pinch. Their weapon systems can often cripple other vehicles in its class, and even damage Tanks|
|Armored Personnel Carriers|APCs are designed to transport infantry across the battlefield. They typically have excellent protection against small arms fire and have a turret-mounted MG or possibly grenade launcher for fire support|
|Reconnaissance Vehicles|Reconnaissance vehicles are infantry fighting vehicles without troop compartments. They are dedicated armored fighting vehicles for forward observation, intelligence gathering, and skirmish operations|
|Light Vehicles|Light vehicles encompass everything from technicals to Humvee-style vehicles and typically have some form of mounted light armament. They usually can carry a number of passengers as well|
|Scout Car|Scout cars or Jeeps are open-topped, nimble vehicles possibly with a mounted MG to provide fire support. They have poor protection against incoming fire|
|Anti-Tank Light Vehicles|AT Light Vehicles are light vehicles that have an anti-tank missile launcher mounted on them. They are the definition of a glass cannon in that they pack a huge punch but are quite vulnerable to all kinds of incoming fire|
|Anti-Air Artillery|AA vehicles are vehicles that have the capability to strike against air targets, such as helicopters. Their guns also can be used in a ground-fire support role as well|
|Motorbikes|Small motorbikes provide quick personal transportation. They are vulnerable to small arms fire but are extremely nimble and small targets|
|
|Artillery Vehicles|Artillery Vehicles provide long-range indirect fire support. They typically require a good deal of coordination and skill to fire effectively. However, their impact on the battlefield, when used effectively, cannot be denied.|
|Logistics|Logis are crucial in an army's supply chain, making sure construction and ammo supplies are getting to where they need to be. Truck logis are the basic variant. They offer reasonable speed, a large supply load of 3000, and can hold a full squad plus one (10).Light vehicles are faster than trucks, but hold less supplies and fewer infantry. Some are also harder to handle due to the high speed.  The APC variants provide better protection against small arms fire, but are less maneuverable and hold less supplies (typically 2000). Some of them can swim in water. The amount of infantry carried vary from 3 to 9.|
|Transports|Transports are used to hold infantry. The basic transport truck can carry 16 infantrymen|
|Boats|Boats are transport or logistic vehicles capable of traversing water at high speed but have poor protection against incoming fire|
|Transport Helicopters|Transport Helicopters can transport infantry across the battlefield in a quick and versatile way. They are also crucial in an army's supply chain, making sure construction and ammo supplies are getting to where they need to be.|
|Attack Helicopters|Attack Helicopters are not really meant for troop transportation. With their miniguns and high-explosive rockets they can root out and destroy large groups of infantry quickly. The rockets can even be used against lightly armored targets|
