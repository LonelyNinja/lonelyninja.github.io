# Server Status & Seeding

In the server seeding channel, there is an auto updated message that shows the server  pop, current map and next map. This message is persistent and doesn’t need interaction to function. You can also find the server pop by looking at the tt-SquadJS Bot or typing `!server` in any channel (this message doesn’t update)

The server has set population, time and map parameters that automatically put it in seeding mode. This sends out seeding reminders ingame for all players, and posts a seeding message in Discord. The channel auto-clears itself when the server is live. Admins are still able to post in the channel to call for seeders and give any server updates.

The seeder role was (and still is) assigned manually by HQ.  We now have a bot that will assign the role to anyone that responds to the seeding emoji on the first post.  They can unreact to remove the role if they wish. We need to advertise this function as much as possible and have people sign up for the role that are able to help
