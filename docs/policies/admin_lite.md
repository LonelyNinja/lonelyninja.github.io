title: Admin Lite
---

# TL;DR

The gist is:

* Represent TT in a positive light when you're playing
* Watch for egregious issues (racism, teamm killing, cheats, solo vehicles, kit issues, toxicity, etc.)
* Help with map voting
* When in doubt, go to a HQ member for help

# Admin Lite Responsibilities

We ask Lites to take action when they observe a rules violation and  investigate player reports. 

Lite actions should focus on obvious offenses such as team killing, racist language, blatant exploits, solo vehicles, kit rules, and clear cut griefing.

Lites have the ability to escalate problems to HQ members. Lites should provide as much relevant information as they can, but should defer to HQ decisions in-game when asked. Lites may follow up on any potential mistakes or challenges in Discord.
Maximum ban length: 2 days.

Admin Lites act as the eyes and ears of the server. Who did you kick today? Did someone do a stupid and you had a good laugh? Let us know what’s going on, keep everyone informed, and try to have a good time. Lites are encouraged to ask questions if they are unsure how to approach a situation or have not dealt with a situation before. Lites can contribute ideas, suggestions, or problems they have in the `#admin-barracks` channel. 

Admin Lites will attend a quarterly meeting with the rest of the admin team.

# Admin Lite Guidelines

Situation:

> As the server grows in popularity and time populated, the HQ team has been unable to keep up with the timezone demands and this has resulted in the server being adminless at times or non NA primetime admins being overworked. These times of server pop have had much lower levels of gameplay, higher instances of player base issues and problem players not being removed.

Intent:
> Solve this by creating much wider and more consistent admin coverage, thereby increasing server quality and decreasing admin work load.

Implementation:
> In addition to recruiting full HQ members from those timezones, we are recruiting junior members of the TT community or those that don’t want the hassle of being a full HQ member, but want to deal with major server issues when no HQ members are active

# Policy

Keep admin actions to a minimum when HQ members are online unless asked to or a situation isn’t being resolved.

You and your actions will be held to a high standard as you represent us all, please keep everything mature and professional. You will not have the same responsibility level or activity requirements as HQ. Help out when you are on and see something, but don’t stress about it. Avoid drama and ask for assistance as needed. You do not have access to long bans; if there are repeat offenders that keep rejoining the server or players causing severe issues that you feel deserve a ban, **tag @HQ** in Discord and we will help ASAP. Make sure to write in `#problem-players` any bans that you believe should be implemented or major problem players you ran into. 

Write any questions you have on actions or possible situations in the admin lite room. We gave you the power because we trust you to do what you think is best. All of us are always open for clarification and working to be better.

**Kick/ban format**: Clearly state the rule broken and what to change, and discuss @discord.io/trig
If you have any questions or concerns regarding player interaction please contact `@relations`, `Kievn` or `Randy`. They will smooth out any drama.

## Enforcing the Rules

Have a clear understanding of the [rules and TT primer/ideals](../server/server_rules.md), but also know where the limit of the admin lite mandate is. Admin lites should be enforcing clear black and white rules that are game-breaking, as well as other severe acts such as teamkilling, offensive language directed at players, severe chat and mic spam, obvious trolling/harming of team, oneman locked squads that aren’t heli/logi/recon vehicles.

### Dealing with no mic SLs/non SL kit squads 
Use your best judgment here, if there aren’t players willing to step up and take over a squad, then constantly kicking or disbanding solves nothing. Do what you think will help the team without fucking overly ignorant/new players. Use warns liberally to save the kicks and disbands for unresponsive. In the end if the squad is working with the team and slightly organized, leave it alone.

Have patience during seeding and do your best to curb players rather than kicking them and dropping server pop, use the !kill command in adminchat to disrupt their actions and tell them why it was done.

# Final Comments

Most of all, have fun on the server and help create the environment that first brought you to the server. Your number one job is having fun, and after that help with enforcement where and when you can. We appreciate anyone willing to step out of their comfort zone for the greater good of the community, and will back you and any reasonable actions.

Again thank you for accepting this position and if you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to ask any member of HQ, anything. More specific points of contact are.
