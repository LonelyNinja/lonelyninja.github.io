When a match of Squad concludes the Scoreboard will appear and afterwards players on each team will be provided a selection to vote for the layer and then the faction they wish to play. </p> <p>With the addition of the voting system, factions have been broken down now into units that have their own specialities. Currently these specialties are represented by having a unique lineup of vehicles and FOB emplacements. In the future, this may be expanded to include unique weapons, roles, and commander abilities. These different units can show up in the voting options when voting for which team to play. Unit types currently represented are combined arms (these are similar to how factions were set up before voting), air assault, armored, light infantry, mechanized, motorized, support, and amphibious assault. </p> <p>With the addition of the voting system, the amount of gameplay layers has been consolidated now that new layers are no longer required for different factions match-ups (down from 453 to 203). Additional unique layers will be introduced in future updates. </p> <p>The full list of units, layers, and which units can be played on what layer can be found below.</p> <p>Faction Unit and Map Layer Sheet Reference</p> <p>Public-Facing Unit Templates - 7.2</p> <p>The Layer Voting System allows Server Owners to:</p> <p>Configure the number of layers and factions to be voted on (2 to 6). The default is 6.</p> <p>Configure the time given to vote for layers  (20 to 90 seconds). The default is 90 seconds.</p> <p>Configure the time given to vote for factions and units (20 to 60 seconds). The default is 60 seconds.</p> <p>Configure how many rounds before the same game mode, map, layer, factions, and units can be available to be voted on again.</p> <p>Server Owners can also set two different pools of layers that will be available for voting:</p> <p>One for low-population server conditions (Ideal for Seeding and Skirmish)</p> <p>Server Owners will be able to set what they consider \u201clow population\u201d using a LowPlayerCountThreshold.cfg</p> <p>One for normal, fully-populated server conditions</p> <p>Server Owners will be able to blacklist certain factions or units from the layers using their layer pool. </p> <p>\ud83d\udd35 Blacklisting can be done either through ExcludedFactions.cfg file globally or for specific layers in the respective voting config files.</p> <p>Layer voting is optional but there are changes to note.</p> <p>There will be a notable decrease in layers to choose from with the voting system from 453 to 203 currently. This is due to duplicate layers using different factions being removed. Layers were cut to consolidate Main Base locations in fewer locations on a given map and to accommodate all possible vehicle spawns needed for a faction.</p> <p>To alleviate this problem, Server Owners will be given more flexibility when setting a static layer rotation.</p> <p>Notable Console Commands</p> <p>AdminChangeLayer - Change the layer and travel to it immediately, no vote will occur.</p> <p>AdminSetNextLayer - Sets the next layer to travel to after this match ends, no vote will occur.</p> <p>AdminSetNextLevel - Sets the next layer to travel to this map after this match ends, no vote will occur.</p> <p>AdminClearNextLayer - Clears the selection of the next layer (ONLY WHEN LAYER VOTING IS ENABLED - SEE \u201cSERVER CONFIGURATION\u201d)</p> <p>AdminChangeLayer and AdminSetNextLayer were adjusted to a new layer structure. These accept faction IDs as parameters</p> <p>Example Below: Set a new layer to Anvil_AAS_v1 with factions BAF vs INS.</p> <p>AdminSetNextLayer Anvil_AAS_v1 BAF INS</p> <p>Example Below: Set a new layer to Anvil_AAS_v1 with factions BAF Motorized Unit vs INS.</p> <p>AdminSetNextLayer Anvil_AAS_v1 BAF+Motorized INS</p> <p>\u26a0\ufe0f If any layer or level is set using AdminSetNextLayer while Layer Voting is enabled, the voting stage at the end of a match WILL NOT start and the server will be moved to the next selected layer, instead. The new command AdminClearNextLayer can be used to reset any selected upcoming layer/level, and re-enable Layer Voting for the next layer.</p> <p>Server Configuration</p> <p>To ENABLE the Layer Voting system on your server, you will need to change the Map Rotation Mode in your Server.cfg file by changing the MapRotationMode entry to LayerList_Vote (example below). </p> <p>MapRotationMode=LayerList_Vote</p> <p>To define possible voting options, there are 4 additional files Server Owners will need to be aware of</p> <p>LayerVoting.cfg - Used for listing layers, as well as factions that can be voted on during layer votes.</p> <p>LayerVotingLowPlayers.cfg - Used when server player count is below the value set for LowPlayerCountThreshold in VoteConfig.cfg (see next point). This file can be deleted if only one mode is desired (Please be aware that updating the server using the validate option may restore the file).</p> <p>LayerVotingNight.cfg - Used on selected timeframe configured in VoteConfig.cfg</p> <p>VoteConfig.cfg - Used for general layer voting configuration, as well as when to switch between using LayerVoting.cfg and LayerVotingLowPlayers.cfg. </p> <p>These configuration files will be loaded and used as a source for picking voting options based on the number of players on the server. These are covered below.</p> <p>LayerVoting.cfg is ideally used for listing layers you\u2019d like to be played during NORMAL or FULL  server populations, such as AAS / RAAS, and Invasion layers.</p> <p>LayerVotingLowPlayers.cfg is ideally used for listing layers you\u2019d like to be played during LOW server populations, such as Seeding and Skirmish layers.</p> <p>The default Map Rotation Mode for a freshly installed server will be set to Layer Voting.</p> <p>\u26a0\ufe0f The structure of both Layer config files is the same, containing a SINGLE layer entry per line.</p> <p>Layer_Name|Exclude_Options_Team1|Exclude_Options_Team2</p> <p>A few examples of Layer entries and relevant parameters to put in LayerVoting.cfg and LayerVotingLowPlayers.cfg:</p> <p>Example</p> <p>Effect</p> <p>Anvil_AAS_v1</p> <p>Uses the Anvil_AAS_v1 layer with all faction and unit possibilities.</p> <p>Anvil_Invasion_v1|BAF</p> <p>EXCLUDE the BAF faction from the voting pool for BOTH TEAMS.</p> <p>Anvil_Invasion_v1|BAF|</p> <p>Second pipe character \u201c|\u201d at the end.

The number of possible layers has been reduced so if there are still some records for removed layers in your configuration files they will be EXCLUDED. There are two new ways for Server Owners to define a list of layers:</p> <p>Anvil_AAS_v1</p> <p>This will load the Anvil_AAS_v1 layer with a predefined factions setup.</p> <p>Anvil_AAS_v1 USA RDF</p> <p>This will change the factions used on the selected layer.

We categorize the advantage into four buckets (ordered here in terms of most to least information advantage):</p> <p>(1) One team has 100% certainty to confirm the lane, other team has 0% chance to confirm the lane - in this case one team knows for certain that they have an advantage (2) One team has 100% certainty to confirm the lane, other team has &gt;0% chance to confirm the lane (3) One team is more likely to confirm the lane than the other team, but neither team has 100% certainty to confirm the lane (4) Both teams have equal likelihood to confirm the lane</p> <p>Then we summarize the information advantage in two ways.

Their guns also can be used in a ground-fire support role as well Motorbikes Small motorbikes provide quick personal transportation. They are vulnerable to small arms fire but are extremely nimble and small targets Artillery Vehicles Artillery Vehicles provide long-range indirect fire support. They typically require a good deal of coordination and skill to fire effectively. However, their impact on the battlefield, when used effectively, cannot be denied. Logistics Logis are crucial in an army's supply chain, making sure construction and ammo supplies are getting to where they need to be. Truck logis are the basic variant. They offer reasonable speed, a large supply load of 3000, and can hold a full squad plus one (10).Light vehicles are faster than trucks, but hold less supplies and fewer infantry. Some are also harder to handle due to the high speed.  The APC variants provide better protection against small arms fire, but are less maneuverable and hold less supplies (typically 2000). Some of them can swim in water. The amount of infantry carried vary from 3 to 9. Transports Transports are used to hold infantry. The basic transport truck can carry 16 infantrymen Boats Boats are transport or logistic vehicles capable of traversing water at high speed but have poor protection against incoming fire Transport Helicopters Transport Helicopters can transport infantry across the battlefield in a quick and versatile way. They are also crucial in an army's supply chain, making sure construction and ammo supplies are getting to where they need to be. Attack Helicopters Attack Helicopters are not really meant for troop transportation. With their miniguns and high-explosive rockets they can root out and destroy large groups of infantry quickly.

Please ask an admin if you have questions or concerns regarding the designated point for seeding.</p> <p>No emplacements and no vehicles (excluding logistics and transport trucks). Infantry only!</p> <p>FOBs within 150 meters of the centre of the objective point are fair game and may be eliminated by the enemy.</p> <p>FOBs outside 150 meters of the centre of the objective point are ineligible to be attacked and may not be eliminated by the enemy.</p> <p>AFK or Unassigned seeding is allowed; however, once the server is deemed live, AFK and Unassigned players may be removed to make room for the queue and/or active players.</p> <p>The server will be called LIVE only by an admin or a moderator when appropriate, not by player count.
